### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Jack of all trades.
Professionally working in Go, JS and solidity. One man army with Rails.

I like programming languages. I've dive into JS, TS, Go, Python, Ruby, Crystal, Bash, Rust, Nim, Pony, Factor, C#, C, Dart, GDScript, PHP, SQL, Swift, Julia, Solidity, Bash, Elixir, Powershell, and I'm probably missing some.
